# RNA-Cosmos-Visualizing-Genetic-Responses-to-Space

## Challenge
The challenge is to develop a scalable tool that generates clear and engaging visualizations of biological experiments conducted in space, specifically on the ISS. This tool should help scientists quickly understand complex experiments, like Rodent Research Reference Mission-1 (OSD-379) and Rodent Research-23 (OSD-665), by visualizing key data and experimental features, enhancing the accessibility and interpretation of spaceflight research data.

## Solution
RNA Cosmos is an interactive web platform designed for bio scientists and space scientists to visualize RNA sequence data, focusing on the differences between mice in three different habitats: one in space and two on Earth. The platform presents data from two experiments, RNA expression in the liver and the right extensor digitorum longus muscle through interactive plots. These visualizations make it easy for experts to explore and compare biological responses across different environments, helping them to derive insights into how space conditions affect gene expression and overall biological processes.
